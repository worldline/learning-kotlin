## Why switch from Java to Kotlin

Here are some arguments that motivate switching from Java (version 17 LTS at the time of writing) to Kotlin.

- Kotlin supports more targets than Java.
- Kotlin has compile time null-safety (Java Optionals are runtime wrappers for nullable values and null annotations have less features).
- Kotlin strings support interpolation.
- Casting in Kotlin is smart.
- Kotlin functional programming features are better. It even allows to define Type-Safe builders and DSLs.
- Kotlin can be mixed with Java code, thus helping the migration process.
