# Frontend development

Kotlin supports a wide selection of frontend frameworks across all platforms: mobile, desktop and web.

Please find below a glimpse of the possibilities that you can do right from IntelliJ:

- On the desktop side
  - Thanks to JVM support, Kotlin supports [JavaFX](https://openjfx.io/).
    - :bulb: There is even a Kotlin counterpart called [tornadofx](https://tornadofx.io/).
  - [Compose Multiplatform](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/compose-mpp/) brings Jetpack Compose to the desktop, the web and mobile.
- On the web
  - [Ktor](https://ktor.io/docs/creating-interactive-website.html) can use templates engines [such as FreeMarker](https://freemarker.apache.org/) to create server pages.
  - With KotlinJS, developers can create React, nodsjs, or vanilla JS Apps using Kotlin.
  - Kotlin WASM compiles into Web Assembly. It can complement KotlinJS for computation intensive tasks.
- On mobiles
  - Android developers use the [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) UI Framework or the legacy **xml layouts**. It is experimental on iOS.

Kotlin supports cross platform frontend development thanks to **KMP and KMM**

## KMP & KMM

KMP (Kotlin Multiplatform) and KMM (Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile) are the two Kotlin technologies that allow to share a single codebase across multiple targets.

[KMP](https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2021/08/compose-multiplatform-goes-alpha/) relies on Kotlin native and other Kotlin features to help developers create projects that target multiple platforms using a common Kotlin code-base.

![KMP](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/images/kotlin-multiplatform.png)

Many combinations of targets and use cases are possible:

- [Full-Stack web apps](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform-full-stack-app.html): A project that contains a backend and a web app while sharing common logic.
- [Multiplatform libraries](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform-library.html)
- [KMM](https://kotlinlang.org/lp/mobile/): a special denomination for KMP when used for iOS and Android projects.

KMM is based on KMP and focuses on helping mobile developers create Cross-Platform SDK for common code.

## Kotlin/JS and Kotlin/WASM

- Kotlin/JS can also target the web and even use web frameworks (such as react) in Kolitn.
- Kotlin WASM is another possibility to target the web but this will generate WASM instead of pure JS code.
  - It can be used for example to develop computation intensive libraries.
- Maybe we can do even more in the future with as all these technologies (Kotlin, WASM and Kotlin/WASM) evolve. - For example, [WASI](https://wasi.dev/) allows WASM to communicate with the operating system. - This means that me may see Kotlin/WASM project projects in the future that can target both the browser and the OS.
- Let's keep watching 😄.

### PW: Kotlin/WASM web app

- Both Kotlin/WASM and Kotlin/JS wizards on IntelliJ work similarly.
  - The IDE generates a Kotlin file that will compile later WASM and / or JS. Kotlin/JS generated only JS while Kotin/WASM generates both JS and WASM.
  - In both cases, the entry point of the generated code is a JS file called **module_name.js**.
  - The IDE also generates an **index.html** in the resources folder which loads the generated JS explained above (the one named **module_name.js**).
  - The task `wasmBrowserDevelopmentRun` or `jsWasmBrowserDevelopmentRun` will run a local server that hosts both the **index.html** files and the generated JS and WASM files.
- Let's create a Kotlin/WASM app. First, Enable the kotlin wasm wizard by enabling **kotlin.wasm.wizard** in IntelliJ's registry (open the registry by double tapping shift and typing "registry" in the search box) or clone [this project](https://github.com/worldline/learning-kotlin/tree/main/material/kotlin-wasm-starter).

![](../../assets/kotlin-wasm-flag.png)

- Check that kotlin is set to at least **1.8.20** in **build.gradle.kts** (the wizard may set it to a previous version).
- Open **src/wasmMain/kotlin/sample.kt** and click on the run button that appears next to the `main` function.
- If the build fails because the IDE used the wrong gradle task (the one that corresponds to a KotlinJS project), please change it to `wasmBrowserDevelopmentRun` and try to run again.

![](../../assets/wasm-build-conf-edit.png)
![](../../assets/wasm-run-configuration.png)

- The development server should start and you can open your WASM powered webapp on [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)
- ⚠️ You may need to activate some flags on your browser for the app to work. If you see a blank page, please read the browser logs to check for the instructions.

![](../../assets/kotlin-wasm-webapp.png)

- The generated wasm file is available in **build/js/packages/project_name/kotlin**
- WASM being a binary format, we need to convert it first to text format.
  - We can either install [WABT (The WebAssembly Binary Toolkit or wabbit)](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt) and use the _wasm2wattool_ `wasm2wat --enable-all  -v .\kotlin-wasm-demo-wasm.wasm -o wasm.wat`,
  - or use an online converter [such as this one](https://webassembly.github.io/wabt/demo/wasm2wat/)
  - ❗ However, I couldn't get it to work

### PW: KotlinJS web app

The Kotlin/JS wizard creates a very similar app to the Kotlin/WASM.
in a later PW, we'll create a fullstack app with Ktor and Kotlin/JS.

## Compose

[Compose multiplatform](https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2021/08/compose-multiplatform-goes-alpha/) is a family of declarative UI frameworks for Android (Jetpack Compose), the desktop (Compose Desktop), and the web (Compose Web). It has experimental support for iOS and Web Canvas.

::: warning Compose multiplatform vs Jetpack Compose

While very similar, Compose multiplatform is different from Jetpack Compose as the latter is only compatible with Android.
Google provides a [JetPack compose tutorial](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/tutorial) for Android development.

:::

::: tip Compose Web vs Compose for Web Canvas

- Compose Web's API surface is different that other Compose targets because it works directly with the DOM.
- Compose for Web Canvas has the same API surface as the Desktop and Android because it draws on a Canvas and does not manipulate on the DOM.

This means that the first one has better web support and the second one has more reusable code.

:::

### PW: Compose web

- Create a new IntelliJ project -> Compose Multiplaform.
- Choose "Single platform" -> "Web" and fill the other fields.
- Choose **Finish**
- IntelliJ may take some time to prepare the project and may request to install additional plugins.
- Launch the development server of the web app sing this command ` ./gradlew jsBrowserRun --continuous`.
- Modify `Main.kt` as follows and run the app.
- Open this address: `localhost:8080`.

```kotlin
fun main() {
    renderComposable(rootElementId = "root") {
        Div({ style { padding(25.px) } }) {
            var expanded by remember { mutableStateOf(false) }
            Button(
                attrs = {
                    onClick { expanded = !expanded }
                }
            ) { Text("Click me") }
            Div({ style { display(if (expanded) DisplayStyle.Block else DisplayStyle.None) } }) {
                Text("Click me !")
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### PW: Compose desktop + Android app

- Create a new project on IntelliJ -> Compose Multiplatform.
- Choose "multiple platforms" and fill the other fields. Then choose **Finish**.
- IntelliJ starts preparing the project and may request to install plugins.
- Once ready, run the android app using the green run button.
- Run the Desktop app by running the main function on the desktop project (should be in `Main.kt`).
- Modify `App.kt` in the main project as follows and run the app.

```kotlin
@Composable
fun App() {
    val platformName = getPlatformName()
    Card {
        var expanded by remember { mutableStateOf(false) }
        Column(Modifier.clickable { expanded = !expanded }) {
            Text(
                text="Click me !",
                style = MaterialTheme.typography.h2
            )
            AnimatedVisibility(expanded){
                Text(
                    text = "Hello, ${platformName} 🎊",
                    style = MaterialTheme.typography.h1
                )
            }
        }
    }
}
```
