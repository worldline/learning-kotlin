# Learning Kotlin - Java2Kotlin Exercise

## From Java to Kotlin! (5 minutes)

1. Have a look at the Java class we provided you in the `src/main/java/com/worldline/learning/kotlin/java2kotlin` package. *(yes, that's the Pokemon class)*
2. Convert that Java class in Kotlin using IntelliJ's awesome copy-pasta tool! *(just copy paste the java code in a kotlin file, one is provided at `src/main/kotlin/com/worldline/learning/kotlin/java2kotlin`)*
3. Have a look at the generated Kotlin code, and note the major differences you spot!

## Discussion!

Now we'll take a little bit of time to comment together the major differences of Java and Kotlin syntax in some basic source code.
